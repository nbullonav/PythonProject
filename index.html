    <h1> Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio </h1>
    <p> The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase several skills.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2> Web Scrapping with Python</h2>
    <p> I've successfully retrieved data from a Python module called "Meteostat" which provides Weather Station information and Metheorological data as far back as 1950's. </p>
    <p> The target chosen was stations located in Perú. Because Perú is geographically located in the Pacific coast and is cyclically affected by El Niño (or La Niña) phenomenon, I've considered that the data would reflect these climate symptoms more clearly. </p>
