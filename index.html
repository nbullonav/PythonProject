    <h1> Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio </h1>
    <p> The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase several skills.</p>
    <h2> Web Scrapping </h2>
    <p> I've successfully retrieved data from a Python module called "Meteostat" which provides Weather Station information and Metheorological data as far back as 1950's. </p>
    <p> The target chosen was stations located in Perú. Given that Perú is geographically located in the Pacific coast and is cyclically affected by El Niño (or La Niña) phenomenon, I considered the data would reflect these climate symptoms more clearly. </p>
